# Ethereum Security Audit Assignment

A comprehensive security audit of a vulnerable PiggyBank smart contract, demonstrating identification and remediation of critical vulnerabilities.

## 📋 Assignment Overview

This repository contains:
1. **Original Vulnerable Contract** - Identifying security flaws
2. **Fixed Secure Contract** - Implementing security best practices  
3. **Attack Contract** - Demonstrating exploitation of vulnerabilities
4. **Security Analysis** - Comprehensive vulnerability assessment

## 🚨 Vulnerabilities Identified

### Critical Vulnerabilities in `VulnerablePiggyBank.sol`:

1. **Access Control Bypass (Critical)**
   - **Issue**: Anyone can call `withdraw()` and drain all funds
   - **Impact**: Complete loss of all user deposits
   - **Line**: `function withdraw() public`

2. **Missing Balance Tracking (High)**
   - **Issue**: Deposits accepted but no per-user balance tracking
   - **Impact**: Users cannot track or withdraw only their funds
   - **Line**: `function deposit() public payable {}`

3. **Syntax Error (Low)**
   - **Issue**: Missing semicolon in constructor
   - **Impact**: Compilation error
   - **Line**: `owner = msg.sender` (missing `;`)

## 🔒 Security Fixes Implemented

### `SecurePiggyBank.sol` Improvements:

1. **Access Control**
   ```solidity
   modifier onlyOwner() {
       require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
       _;
   }
   ```

2. **Individual Balance Tracking**
   ```solidity
   mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
   ```

3. **Withdrawal Pattern (Two-Step Process)**
   - **Step 1**: `withdraw()` - moves funds to pending (safe)
   - **Step 2**: `claimWithdrawal()` - transfers ETH with error handling

4. **Auto-Restore on Failed Transfers**
   ```solidity
   if (!success) {
       pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] = amount;  // Restore funds
       revert("Transfer failed, please try again");
   }
   ```

5. **Events for Transparency**
   - Deposit tracking
   - Withdrawal requests  
   - Transfer failures

## ⚔️ Attack Demonstration

### `SimpleAttacker.sol` Features:

- **Exploits Access Control**: Calls vulnerable `withdraw()` function
- **Complete Drainage**: Steals all funds in single transaction
- **No Reentrancy Needed**: Vulnerable contract sends all funds at once

### Attack Flow:
1. Deploy `SimpleAttacker` with vulnerable contract address
2. Call `attack()` function
3. All funds transferred to attacker contract
4. Attacker can withdraw stolen funds

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Deploy and Test in Remix IDE:

1. **Deploy Vulnerable Contract**
   ```solidity
   VulnerablePiggyBank vulnerable = new VulnerablePiggyBank();
   ```

2. **Simulate User Deposits**
   ```solidity
   // Multiple users deposit funds
   vulnerable.deposit{value: 1 ether}();  // Alice
   vulnerable.deposit{value: 2 ether}();  // Bob
   ```

3. **Deploy Attack Contract**
   ```solidity
   SimpleAttacker attacker = new SimpleAttacker(address(vulnerable));
   ```

4. **Execute Attack**
   ```solidity
   attacker.attack();  // Drains all 3 ETH
   ```

5. **Verify Attack Success**
   ```solidity
   attacker.getStolenAmount();  // Returns 3 ETH
   address(vulnerable).balance; // Returns 0 ETH
   ```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Demonstrated

### Access Control Patterns:
- Owner-only functions with modifiers
- Role-based access control principles

### Reentrancy Protection:
- Effects-before-interactions pattern
- Clear separation of state updates and external calls

### Error Handling:
- Failed transfer recovery mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages
- Auto-restore functionality

### Withdrawal Pattern:
- Two-step withdrawal process
- Reduced attack surface
- Failed transfer protection

## 📊 Gas Optimization

The secure contract includes several gas optimizations:
- Efficient storage layout
- Minimal external calls
- Event-driven architecture for off-chain tracking

## 🔍 Code Quality Features

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: NatSpec comments throughout
- **Clear Function Naming**: Self-documenting code
- **Event Logging**: Full audit trail of all operations
- **Error Messages**: Descriptive failure reasons
- **Modular Design**: Separation of concerns

## 📈 Security Analysis Summary

| Vulnerability | Severity | Original | Fixed | Attack Demo |
